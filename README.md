## ⚙️ How It Works

### Transaction Flow

1. User adds an income or expense transaction.
2. Transaction is stored in React application state.
3. Data is persisted to Local Storage via the `useAppState` hook.
4. Dashboard updates automatically.
5. Forecast chart recalculates financial trends.

### Bill Management Flow

1. User creates an upcoming bill.
2. Bill is stored locally.
3. User can mark the bill as paid.
4. Payment is automatically recorded as an expense transaction.
5. Recurring bills automatically move to the next due date.
